# Pathfinding Algorithms visualized

## What is it
This project was made with HTML, CSS, and JS, and helps demonstrate various pathfinding algorithms (such as [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)).

## Using it
Using the website, is quite simple, follow these steps:
1. Click on the `Cell Type` dropdown, and select the `Start Cell`. This will allow you to specify where the algorithm needs to start searching from.
2. Optionally click on the `Path Cell` which acts like a barrier for where the various algorithms can't move on. (Note that the algorithm's **cannot** move diagonally). Once you have selected the `Path Cell`, you can just move your mouse around the grid to "draw" the obstacles.
3. Set an ending position by using the `End Cell` in the dropdown. As the name implies, it lets you specify the end location for where the algorithm needs to find a path to.

At this point once you have set the `Start Cell`, (optionally any `Path Cells`), and the `End Cell`, you can either press the spacebar to simulate one step in the algorithm, or just press the play button to let the algorithm automatically step forward every `1 second`. 

If at any point you want to pause the algorithm, or just restart, then press the pause or clear buttons repectively!
